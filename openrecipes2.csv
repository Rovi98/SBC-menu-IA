BUT I always make it by hand, using the above ingredients, and this technique. If you like a super-puffy crust, do the folding in Pim's instructions x. I usually like mine less so, and fold &amp; roll just \n  times, depending on how the dough is feeling. The pie in the photo was x.\nBerry Pie Filling\n / . oz / g natural cane\n brown sugar\n / . oz /  g flour (apf\n wwp)\n teaspoon fine grain sea salt\n teaspoon cinnamon\n sprigs thyme (prefer. lemon thyme) ~  t.\n pounds of berries, (see head notes)\n  lemon juice\n  butter\n egg plus  water, whisked\nLarge grain sugar, for sprinkling\nPreheat your oven to F / C, with a rack in the bottom third. Roll out your pie crust - top and bottom - on a flour dusted counter. I tend to work the edges a bit first (particularly if I'm getting cracks) - roll and turn, roll and turn, dusting with flour when necessary. Flip once\n twice. Work quickly and keep the dough moving. Place between unbleached parchment paper\n Silpats, and refrigerate while you make the filling. If you're nervous about rolling out the crust, have a look at the second part of Melissa Clark's video. See how she's not super fussy? Channel some of that. If you need an extra confidence booster, read this. It's o.k. if your dough doesn't roll out into a perfect circle - you can patch and pinch later if needed. Just shoot for \n -inch inch rounds.\nMake the filling by combining the sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, and thyme in large mixing bowl. Add the berries, and toss gently until well combined. Set aside.\nLine a \n -inch pie plate with the bottom piece of pie dough. Guide it into place without stretching. You want about an inch of dough extending past the rim of the pie plate, trim a bit with scissors\n a sharp knife if needed.\nFill the crust with the berries, drizzle with lemon juice, and dot with the butter. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a bit of egg wash, then top with the other piece of pie crust. Trim the top crust a bit if needed, then press the top and bottom crusts together at the edges. Working around the rim, tuck the overhanging dough under itself, and crimp with a fork\n flute using your fingers (see picture up above). Brush the crust with more of the egg wash, cut a few slits into the top, and place in the oven for about  minutes - until the crust is deeply golden. Check your pie regularly after  minutes. If you need to foil the edges of the pie - pull it out and do so - this way the edges wont get too dark and dry. I don't have to foil in my oven for this pie, even at this temp, but your oven might be a bit different. I also sprinkle with large-grain sugar about  minutes in - for a little extra crunch and sweetness. Let cool a bit, slice and serve.\nServes .\n\nPrep time:  min  - \n   Cook time:  min   \n  \nPrint Recipe"
